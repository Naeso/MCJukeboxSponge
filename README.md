# JukeboxAPI
Java API and plugin for [Jukebox](https://mcjukebox.net), web based music player.
This is a port for the SpongeAPI.

# Usage
Please see the [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcjukebox.16024/) resource for more information.
The plugin is still WIP, so there is still no Ore Sponge page for it.

# Support
Since this plugin is still WIP, please make an issue using the issues tab.

This plugin wasn't made by the MCJukebox team, and still waiting for approuval from them, since this plugin uses MCJukebox's services to share music.
