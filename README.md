# JukeboxAPI
Java API and __unofficial__ sponge plugin for [Jukebox](https://mcjukebox.net), web based music player.
This is a __unofficial__ port for the SpongeAPI.

# Usage
Please see the [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mcjukebox.16024/) resource for more information.
The plugin is still WIP, so there is still no Ore Sponge page for it.

# Support
Since this plugin is still WIP, please make an issue using the issues tab.

__This plugin wasn't made by the MCJukebox team, and I am still waiting for approuval from them, since this plugin uses MCJukebox's services to share music. Therefore it is not official and should be used only for personnal and private usage until approuval.__
